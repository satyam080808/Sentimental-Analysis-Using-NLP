# Sentimental-Analysis-Using-NLP

Welcome to our project! This is a **Sentiment Analysis App** built using Python and various machine learning techniques, designed to analyze the sentiments of tweets related to airlines. By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and the **Random Forest Classifier**, this app helps in classifying sentiments as negative, neutral, or positive.

In this project, we preprocess textual data, use **TF-IDF vectorization** to transform text, and calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and more using the **confusion matrix**. Our model is trained and tested on airline tweets, allowing you to visualize sentiment distributions and improve the model further.
